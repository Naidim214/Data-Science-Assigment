Why Use a Blueprint:
Modularity: Blueprints allow you to organize your application into modules, 
            making it easier to manage and scale large applications.
Reusability: Blueprints can be reused across different applications or multiple 
            times within the same application.
Organization: Helps to logically separate different parts of your application, 
            such as authentication, main routes, and admin interfaces.
